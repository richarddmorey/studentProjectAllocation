<p>

All files should be plain text files. Information in each file is given in rows, one for each lecturer, project, or student (depending on the file).

<p>

The items in a row of a file are separated by spaces or tabs(so remember <b>not to include spaces or tabs</b> in any of your IDs).

<p>

Each row of the lecturers file indicates the preferences of a particular lecturer. There are three main pieces of information per lecturer:

<p>

<ol>
	<li>Lecturer ID (character string, no spaces)</li>
	<li>Lecturer capacity (integer)
	<li>List of student IDs (character strings) separated by spaces, in descending order of preference</li>
</ol>

<p>

Each row should define a unique lecturer (no duplicate IDs across rows) and all student IDs given in the preference lists should correspond to a row of the students file. Note that a lecturer does not have to have a preference list, nor do they need to rank every student.


<p>

Because the length of the list of students might differ between lecturers, the number of columns per row in this file will be variable, but will be at least two.

<h4>Example rows</h4>

<pre>
WILLIAMS 5 stu_1135 stu_4052 stu_3942<br/>
CHEN 4 stu_5861 stu_1135
</pre>

The example above defines two lecturers, WILLIAMS and CHEN, with respective capacities of 5 and 4. WILLIAMS has three student IDs in their preference list, and CHEN has two.
